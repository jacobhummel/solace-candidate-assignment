Thank you for taking the time to review my assignment!

Given more time, I would focus on the following:
- Leverage existing standardized component library to reduce verbosity and improve UI consistency - assuming this page is part of a larger app
- Adding infinite scroll or pagination to the results
- If doing client components in this manner, use a data loading library like React Query or SWR to handle data loading
